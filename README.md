# Feed a Mole 
## Demo
Play it [here](https://feedmoles.netlify.app/)
## Overview
Feed A Mole was built during my first week learning with Frontend Masters to review code flow.   
This game reminds me of old school flash games I grew up playing. Simple and amusing.  
Player needs to feed the moles to reach the target before time runs out. It sounds easy but you cannot feed the mole if it turns its bum to you.
After finishing, player can try again to have a better time record.
